            <h1>Emotional Wellness</h1>
            <p>Emotional wellness is focused on self-discovery and acceptance, with the aim of improving our ability to understand and manage our emotions in a healthy way. This dimension of wellness encourages us to build strong, meaningful 
                relationships, foster empathy, and develop coping strategies that allow us to thrive amidst life's challenges. By cultivating emotional wellness, we empower ourselves to achieve a balanced and fulfilling life marked by an optimistic outlook and a profound sense of inner peace.</p>

            <h2>Current Efforts</h2>
            <p>Currently, I have no specific projects in this area of wellness, as my current life phase is devoted to pursuing entrepreneurial interests and establishing systems for generating passive income.</p>
            <h2>Future Efforts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Strengthen Mindset and Work Ethic</b>: I have a pretty strong work ethic, thoughtfulness, and foresight. However, my productivity can fluctuate. To be truly exceptional and leave a legacy, I need to improve my discipline and consistency.</li>
                <li><b>Self-esteem</b>: While I pride myself on being technically adept and dedicated, I've observed the stark contrast in confidence displayed by sales professionals, which sometimes overshadows the quiet competence of those in technical roles. This realization has sparked a desire to cultivate a more assertive presence without compromising my intrinsic humility and introspection. I aim to bridge this gap, ensuring that my confidence is both felt and perceived, enhancing my ability to seize opportunities and assert my value in any setting. This journey is not about outdoing others but about fully embracing and projecting my capabilities, preparing me to lead and inspire with authenticity.</li>
                <li><b>Bonsai</b>: Growing up, I loved exploring the outdoors. Living in Seattle as an engineering student and cooped up in small apartments made it difficult to enjoy nature. I learned that apartment bonsai-ing was a great way to bring nature to me.</li>
                <li><b>Exploring and Defining Masculinity</b>: Growing up fatherless has often left me wondering what elements of masculinity I may have missed and which of these are essential. I’d like to distinguish between the social constructs of masculinity and femininity and understand their (ir)relevance and evolution. I’d also like to dissect the concept of the nuclear family, the father’s role within it, and how I can bridge any gaps in my upbringing to become the father I wish I had for my future kids.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Timeline</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2023: Cemented the fact that everyone's journey is their own.</li>
                <li>2018: Boxing boosted my self-esteem even more.</li>
                <li>2015: Took little actions everyday to push myself out of my comfort zone.</li>
                <li>2015: Tried meditating. Was impatient, got frustrated, and stopped.</li>
            </ul>
