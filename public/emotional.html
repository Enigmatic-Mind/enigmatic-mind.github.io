            <h2>EMOTIONAL WELLNESS</h2>
            <p>Emotional wellness is focused on self-discovery and acceptance, with the aim of improving our ability to understand and manage our emotions in a healthy way. This dimension of wellness encourages us to build strong, meaningful 
                relationships, foster empathy, and develop coping strategies that allow us to thrive amidst life's challenges. By cultivating emotional wellness, we empower ourselves to achieve a balanced and fulfilling life marked by an optimistic outlook and a profound sense of inner peace.</p>        </div>

            <h2>Current Efforts</h2>
            <p>None. I have projects to explore in the future, but the current phase in my life has me focused on generating income.</p>
            <h2>Future Efforts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Strengthen Mindset and Work Ethic</b>: I have a pretty good work ethic, good thought and foresight, but I need to improve my discipline and consistency to make use of every last minute in my day.</li>
                <li><b>Self-esteem</b>: I've noticed that many "sales" people have the upmost confidence in themselves or a product that technical people could easily outdo. I am more technical and introverted, but I will not be outworked by a sales person.</li>
                <li><b>Bonsai</b>: I grew enjoying nature, and living in Seattle as a student made it difficult to enjoy nature. Bonsai helps me reconnect with that from my apartment.</li>
                <li><b>Kombucha</b>: Its a great sugary beverage that is cheaper and healthier than store items. Fermented so good bacteria.</li>
                <li><b>Exploring and Defining Masculinity</b>: Grew up fatherless, so I've felt I need to explore what masculinity is for myself.</li>
            </ul>
