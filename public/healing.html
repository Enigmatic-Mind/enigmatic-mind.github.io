        <h1>Healing (self-therapy)</h1>
        <h2>One Sentence Summary</h2>
        <p>The aim of this project is to heal traumas and chronic stresses that might be weighing me down.</p>
        <p>This project started from having high blood pressure that does not seem to stem from any underlying issues in my body -- my doctor believes it may be from chronic stress. This stress is largely associated with academia but can be tied to further underlying issues. Furthermore, I have social anxiety with connected childhood stresses. Moreover, I have relationship traumas from issues in my marriage. I also want to improve my relationship with my family.</p>

        <h2 class="project_description_heading">Format</h2>
        <p class="project_description_p">How I will accomplish this effort.</p>

        <p class="nopm">My priority is to address the stresses that I have put on myself daily for the past seven years and have caused my blood pressure to rise.
            I will approach this issue by first reading the following books recommended by my doctor:
            <ul class="nopm">
                <li><a href="https://amzn.to/4bEPxmr">Lighter by Yung Pueblo</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://amzn.to/4aPE4yW">How to Meet Your Self: The Workbook for Self-Discovery by Dr. Nicole LePera</a></li>
            </ul>
            Furthermore, I am following my <a href="./marchtooptimalhealth.html">March to Optimal Health</a> to address the neglect I've had of my body. Lastly, I will journal weekly to gauge how I am progressing.
        </p>

        <p>There are many other issues I want to address as I have alluded to the summary, but given how personal and complex it is to address everything, especially while I am still dealing with it, I will reserve
            the specifics until I have resolved them, at which point I can provide better guidance.
        </p>

            <li><b>2023</b>: Tried to get back into running. Started a marathon training plan in summer. Got shin splints. Got sick 2-3 times in one month. Rain season started in Seattle before I could get back to it. My V02 max peaked at 57.</li>
