        <h1>Half-Marathon Training</h1>
        <h2>One Sentence Summary</h2>
        <p>My goal is to run a half-marathon at a 7:30 pace (by June 1, 2024) in a structured approach that will improve my V02 max, meet WHO's exercise recommendations, consistently hit 10k steps daily, and elevate my overall confidence.</p>

        <h2 class="project_description_heading">Format</h2>
        <p class="project_description_p">How I will accomplish this effort.</p>

        <h3>Build-up Plan</h3>
        <p class="nopm"> Until I consistently wake up at 5:30 AM, I will follow my build-up plan:
            <ul>
                <li>Wake up at 5:30 AM. To practice consistently and at a high pace, I need a track, so I need to wake up well before school hours.</li>
                <li>Run 5 days a week (M, Tu, W, Th, Sa).</li>
                <li>Run 6 miles each day.</li>
                <li>Physical therapy exercises at the end of the day.
                    <ul class="nopm">
                        <li>Foam rolling out my shins.</li>
                        <li>Calf raises (including variants -- external and internal rotations).</li>
                        <li>Tib raises with tib bar.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Clean under toe nails on Saturdays.</li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <h3>Training Plan</h3>
        <p class="nopm">I will use my Garmin Fenix 7s watch and it's free "Garmin Coach Half Marathon" program. The program is structured as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Monday</b>: Easy run - 45 minutes at 8 to 9 minutes per mile pace (base pace).</li>
                <li><b>Tuesday</b>: Goal pace run or speed repeats. Alternate between them.
                    <ul class="nopm">
                        <li>Goal pace run - 15 minute warm up at base pace, 20 minutes at 7 minutes per mile, and 15 minute cool down. Warm up and cool down at base pace.</li>
                        <li>Speed repeats - 15 minute warm up at base pace, run at 6 minutes per mile for 1 minute then jog for 1 minute and repeat 6 times, run at 5 minutes per mile for 30 seconds then jog for 1 minute and repeat 6 times, and 15 minute cool down at base pace.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Wednesday</b>: Easy run.</li>
                <li><b>Thursday</b>: Progression run - Base pace for 25 minutes, 10 minutes at 6 minutes per mile pace, and base pace for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li><b>Friday</b>: Rest.</li>
                <li><b>Saturday</b>: Long easy run - 1 hour and 30 minutes at base pace.</li>
                <li><b>Sunday</b>: Rest.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Note, the program is progressive, so there are slight increases every two to three weeks.</p>
        


        <h2 class="project_description_heading">Timeline & Milestones</h2>
        <p class="project_description_p">Up-to-date timeline of project + context.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>2016</b>: Ran 3 miles a day for a month.</li>
            <li><b>2016</b>: "Ran" an unofficial marathon in 4-6 hours. My marathon training was running 8 miles on a weekend, 13 miles the next weekend, and eating lots of fruits and potatoes the day before the marathon.</li>
            <li><b>2019</b>: Tried to get back into running/exercise. No plan and low commitment.</li>
            <li><b>2021</b>: Tried to get back into running/exercise. No plan and low commitment.</li>
            <li><b>2023</b>: Tried to get back into running. Started a marathon training plan in summer. Got shin splints. Got sick 2-3 times in one month. Rain season started in Seattle before I could get back to it. My V02 max peaked at 57.</li>
            <li><b>2024-1</b>: Started to run again. I felt I wasn't accomplishing anything by just running, and I felt stagnant and passive. Base pace was around 9:30 per mile.</li>
            <li><b>2024-2-23</b>: Started my half-marathon training plan.</li>
            <li><b>2024-3-11</b>: Started to get shin splints. Runs were horrible. Feet felt like lead and stiff af. Just touching the area between my anterior tibilas and my tibia BURNED. Decided to take a break and research how to manage shin splints.</li>
            <li><b>2024-3-18</b>: Drafted a shin splint management plan. Taking a week to get my miles up, experiment with my form, and refine my shin splint plan.</li>
            <li><b>2024-4</b>: Issues with toes. Maybe runner's toes? Cleaning corners of nails seemed to help a bit.</li>
            <li><b>2024-5-16</b>: VO2 max dropped to 56 over the past two months. Moving and marriage issues starting to settle down. Not suffering from runners toes or shin splints. Started running again. Running about 4-6 miles a day and 4-6 times a week. Pace is consistently about 8:20.</li>
