        <h1>March To Startup</h1>

        <h2>One Sentence Summary</h2>
        <p>MarchToStartup is an iterative exploration and execution project aimed at identifying and nurturing innovative startup ideas across various industries, with the goal of building a diverse entrepreneurial legacy that achieves multi-billion-dollar success and contributes to human progress.</p>

        <h2 class="project_description_heading">Purpose</h2>
        <p class="project_description_p">The primary motivation and objectives behind this project.</p>
        <p>MarchToStartup is driven by a deep-seated belief in the power of innovation to transform lives and the world for the better. The primary motivations behind this project are to achieve financial independence, contribute to human progress by solving critical needs, and engage deeply in work that is both fulfilling and impactful. Drawing inspiration from visionary figures like Tony Stark and grounded in my personal journey as an immigrant/minority, this project seeks to navigate the cutting edge of technology and societal needs, aiming to discover and develop solutions that significantly improve the human condition.</p>
        <p class="nopm">The project is set upon a foundation of ambitious, sequential goals:
            <ul>
                <li>Achieving $5k/month in passive income within 1-2 years as a means to sustain the mission,</li>
                <li>Securing a $10M startup exit within 3-4 years,</li>
                <li>Having a $100M exit in 8 years, and</li>
                <li>Building a $1B startup within 13 years and eventually nurturing a portfolio of multi-billion dollar companies.</li>
            </ul>

            I started this project in 2024.

        <h2 class="project_description_heading">Updates and Learnings</h2>
        <p class="project_description_p">Edits to timeline and learnings from setbacks.</p>
        <p><b>Learning #1</b>: Just start, unless there is an important reason not to. Speed of action and learnings obtained feed into each other. Initially, I thought I had to do things in a certain sequence, and to some extent I am correct, but I can only know what I needed to know in retrospect. Since what I am doing is low stakes, speed of action is more important than getting the sequence right.</p>
        <p><b>Learning #2</b>: Perfect sequence: mental health, financial base, health base, personal project management + computer organization, learning, and then starting up. Some people need motivation to take action every day, so that is why mental health is first. Motivation was not an issue for me, but I include it to be general. I did step 4 next since I am a PhD student and managing all my projects going on in my life was becoming chaotic. I skipped step 2 and have been half-assing step 3 for about a month and a half; I should have solidified those and then focused on learning to start up. It's likely you are not going to be an overnight success. It will take time. You need to make yourself financial stable and healthy enough to see that success and enjoy it. Once the actions become habits, proceed. Finally, I created a company (LLC) before even learning. I don't even have anything to sell, why create a company so early on?! Now I need to learn about tax and legal matters to remain compliant.</p>
