        <h1>About me</h1>

        <h2 class="borderless">Bio.</h2>
        <p>
            I am deeply passtionate about innovation and entrepreneurship. In 2024, I made the bold decision to leave my Ph.D. program in electrical engineering, where I was working on developing an AI-driven application for wound analysis in healthcare. My goal now is to master UX/UI design and web, iOS, and Android development. This path is aimed at launching software services that may evolve into startups, ultimately funding greater and greater visions for impactful technology.
        </p>
        <h2 class="borderless">My skills.</h2>
        <p>
            My skill set is best described as dynamic and versatile. Starting in high school, I earned an associate's degree in Business Administration, delving into the fundamentals of accounting and business. My journey continued at the University of Washington, where I pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering (EE), completing over twenty-one EE classes. I graduated with multiple capstone projects in VLSI, embedded systems, and analog integrated circuits -- only one track/capstone was required. Yes, I hated myself for the majority of my intensely project-filled senior year, but this helped me significantly hone my technical and project management skills. I went on to intern twice at NVIDIA, contributing to energy efficiency improvements in high-profile GPUs like the RTX 4090 and applying my skills in VLSI, Python, unsupervised machine learning, Linux/terminal, and C/C++. However, my growing interest in the applications of computer vision and machine learning led me to pursue a Master's degree. As a graduate student, I lead a medical research project and further expanded my skill set to include computer vision fundamentals, machine learning fundamentals, user-centered design, iOS app development, commercialization strategies, lean startup methodology, technical/grant writing, and medical research. This eclectic and intensive learning journey makes it challenging to narrow down my skills; nevertheless, my journey reflects a deep passion for innovation and a relentless pursuit of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            The amorphous skills that I take great pride in include my critical thinking, analytical, and communication skills. These skills, combined with my relentless work ethic, enable me to excel in any field I choose to pursue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am dedicated to honing my skills in UX/UI design (Figma), full-stack web development, iOS app development (Swift + Xcode), and Android app development (Kotlin). In the future, I am interested in exploring blockchain technology (Algorand), deep learning/artifical intelligence, and AR/VR.
        </p>

        <h2 class="borderless">My story.</h2>
        <p>
            I could fill an autobiography with the details of my journey thus far, yet here, I'll aim for brevity. Learn more about drives me, where I'm headed, and the reasons why.
