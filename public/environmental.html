            <h1>ENVIRONMENTAL WELLNESS</h1>
            <p>Environmental wellness begins right at our doorstep, with mindful stewardship of our immediate surroundings—our homes and belongings. It's about nurturing a mindful relationship with the spaces we occupy daily, ensuring they reflect our commitment to sustainability. This wellness area then extends outward, encouraging us to engage with our communities through initiatives that promote environmental health and awareness. Ultimately, it encompasses a global perspective, urging us to consider how our actions contribute to the planet's well-being. Environmental wellness is a holistic journey from micro to macro, emphasizing the critical role each individual plays in protecting nature, fostering a sustainable environment, and acting as responsible stewards for future generations.</p>

            <h2>Current Efforts</h2>
            <p>Currently, I have no specific projects in this area of wellness, as my current life phase is devoted to pursuing entrepreneurial interests and establishing systems for generating passive income.</p>
            <h2>Future Efforts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Routine Home Maintenance</b>: A clear mind starts with a clean home. Regular, scheduled cleaning proves to be more efficient and less burdensome than intermittent, haphazard efforts. As my wife and I transition from frequently moving apartments to establishing a more permanent residence, honing a sustainable cleaning routine becomes important. This gives us a serene living environment but also symbolizes our commitment to environmental stewardship, starting within the walls of our home.</li>
                <li><b>Routine Car Maintenance</b>: The unexpected breakdown of our Nissan's transmission was a hard lesson in the true cost and stress of emergency repairs. This experience has taught us the value of proactive, scheduled maintenance over reactive fixes. While we've become more mindful with our current vehicle, there's room to further refine and automate our maintenance schedule. Establishing a routine for periodic checkups will not only extend the life of our car but also ensure our peace of mind on the road.</li>
                <li><b>Belongings Maintenance</b>: 'An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.’ I've recognized the importance of regular care for my valued possessions. Creating a routine maintenance schedule ensures their longevity and reliability. This practice not only saves resources but also honors the role these items play in my life, allowing me to focus on enjoying them to the fullest without the interruption of unexpected repairs or replacements.</li>
                <li><b>Pale Blue Dot Initiative</b>:  Building on the foundation of tidiness and care within our home, I am motivated to explore broader actions that can minimize our environmental footprint. This initiative represents a journey beyond personal and family wellness into the realm of global stewardship. By researching and implementing sustainable practices, I aim to contribute to a healthier planet, reinforcing the belief that every individual effort, no matter how small, can have a significant impact on our collective future.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Timeline</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-2023: All maintenance and cleaning is haphazard. No proactive actions.</li>
            </ul>
