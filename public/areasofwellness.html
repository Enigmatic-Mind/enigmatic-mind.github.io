        <h1>About Areas of Wellness</h1>
        <p>
            Every project we undertake in life — what I like to refer to as “efforts” — can be categorized within an area of wellness. This framework enables us to track our efforts with mindfulness of our focus areas and those we may be neglecting. 
            Life’s phases and circumstances demand shifts in our focus and priorities, and that’s perfectly natural. This framework serves as a gentle guide, encouraging us toward well-rounded improvement over time. Explore the efforts I’m currently 
            engaged in across each wellness area, and perhaps find inspiration to enhance your own journey.
