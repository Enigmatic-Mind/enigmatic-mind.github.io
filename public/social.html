            <h2>Current Efforts</h2>
            <p>None. I have projects to explore in the future, but the current phase in my life has me focused on generating income.</p>
            <h2>Future Efforts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Marriage</b>: I don't want to wake up in a year and realize my wife is fed up with my intense focus on starting up. Want to have a understanding of minimum time spent together that makes us feel content in our marriage and prepared for kids in the future.</li>
                <li><b>Family</b>: Similar to my marriage, I don't want to wait until its too late to start to reconnect with my family. Moving away to university and studying engineering for 6 years kept us separated for a bit.</li>
                <li><b>Improving Communication</b>: I have a clear intuition and visualization of systems and relationships, but I struggle to communicate. I want to make sure my communication is clear. This includes having foresight on the context, the audience, etc and being able to navigate it.</li>
                <li><b>Improving Social Skills</b>: I'm introverted and didn't really have close friends growing up. I'm fascinated by people who are friendly and can connect with others if nothing but for being friendly and positive.</li>
                <li><b>Friends</b>: I want to find a group of friends who have similar journeys and drive as me, and possibly interests. </li>
