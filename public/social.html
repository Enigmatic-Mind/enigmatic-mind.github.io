            <h1>Social Wellness</h1>
            <p>This dimension involves building healthy, nurturing, and supportive relationships as well as fostering genuine connections with those around you. Social wellness is about contributing to your community and maintaining a well-balanced social life.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Current Efforts</h2>
            <p>Currently, I have no specific projects in this area of wellness, as my current life phase is devoted to pursuing entrepreneurial interests and establishing systems for generating passive income.</p>
            <h2>Future Efforts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Marriage</b>: My commitment to entrepreneurship is unwavering, yet I'm equally devoted to nurturing my marriage. It's crucial to find a harmonious balance that ensures both my wife and I feel fulfilled and connected. Establishing a clear understanding of the quality time needed to sustain our relationship is key, laying a strong foundation for our future together and eventual parenthood.</li>
                <li><b>Family</b>: The years spent pursuing my engineering degree and the distance it created have made me more aware of the importance of family connections. I want to focus further on bridging the gap that time and space have introduced, ensuring that I actively foster and rebuild the ties with my family, preventing distance from turning into detachment.</li>
                <li><b>Improving Communication</b>: My ability to intuitively grasp systems and relationships needs to be matched with effective communication. I aim to refine my skills to ensure clarity and impact in my interactions, considering the audience and context to navigate conversations more adeptly.</li>
                <li><b>Improving Social Skills</b>: As an introvert who grew up without many close friendships, I admire the ease with which some people foster connections. I'm dedicated to developing my social skills, learning to engage more openly and positively, to enrich both my personal and professional life.</li>
                <li><b>Cultivating Meaningful Friendships</b>: I seek to surround myself with friends who share my drive, aspirations, and perhaps interests. Building a network of like-minded individuals is not just about shared journeys but also about mutual support and inspiration as we navigate our paths.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Timeline</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Current: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't really have any <b>close</b> friends, but I have friends.</li>
                    <li>I don't know how to just shoot the breeze. If I am not actively doing something, I feel like I am just wasting time.</li>
                    <li>Don't understand parties, social mixers, etc. Don't drink or do drugs. Don't stay up late. Networking with investors is going to be a challenge... Where are the investors and founders that want to connect over a run, hike, sparring match, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>2019: Got married.</li>
                <li>2017: Joined a frat to improve social skills. Left after two quarters because of how much of a time sink it was.</li>
                <li>2016: Explored how to "pickup" women to make up for missing father guidance and lack of friends. The experience was complex, with both positive and negative aspects, meriting deeper reflection.</li>
            </ul>
