            <h2>LIFEOPS</h2>
            <p>LifeOps stands as a meta area of wellness, offering the framework and tools to structure, manage, and optimize every facet of our lives for ultimate success and fulfillment. It encompasses goal planning, life management, and personal organization—essential components that underpin and enhance our journey across all other areas of wellness.

            <h2>Current Efforts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Project and Task Management System (Obsidian)</b>: After experimenting with various project and task management systems without success, I took the initiative during the winter break of 2023 to develop my system using Obsidian. It has significantly improved my organization and productivity, though it's still a work in progress requiring further refinement for optimal efficiency.</li>
                <li><b>Computer File Organization and Productivity App Exploration</b>: My approach to file and folder management used to be chaotic, complicating my ability to locate specific documents. I've since restructured my digital organization, limiting file storage to a few predictable locations. This system ensures that even the most elusive file is never more than 30 minutes away, vastly improving my workflow and reducing digital clutter.</li>
                <li><b>System Maintenance</b>: Establishing effective systems and protocols is just the beginning; the real challenge lies in adhering to them and performing regular reviews for potential enhancements. This ongoing process of maintenance and adjustment is crucial to sustaining productivity and ensuring that my organizational methods evolve with my changing needs and circumstances.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Efforts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Preparation, Readiness, and Survival Training</b>: Embracing a proactive stance towards personal safety and security, I aim to equip myself with the knowledge and skills necessary for navigating a wide range of emergency situations. This commitment to preparation and survival training is about fostering resilience and ensuring that I can confidently face unexpected challenges, safeguarding myself and those around me.</li>
                <li><b>Life Planning</b>: Recognizing the importance of direction and intention in one’s journey, I am dedicated to developing a broad outline of my life's aspirations and goals. This life planning process is about understanding my values, passions, and potential impact, providing a guiding framework that helps navigate the complexities of life with a sense of purpose and fulfillment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Timeline</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2024-1: Started to clean up over 7 years of folders and files I've collected on my computer and drives.</li>
                <li>2023-12: Made a personal project and task management system with Obsidian.</li>
