            <h2>SPIRITUAL WELLNESS</h2>
            <p>Spiritual wellness explores the values and beliefs that provide a purpose in life. It can involve religion, meditation, mindfulness, or a deep connection with nature and the universe, guiding individuals towards inner peace and understanding.</p>

            <h2>Current Efforts</h2>
            <p>None. I have projects to explore in the future, but the current phase in my life has me focused on generating income.</p>
            <h2>Future Efforts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Religion</b>: I grew up catholic and lutheran. However, I am also inquisitive and have the mind of an engineer, 
                    which is to say that I am curious about religion from all aspects. Which religion? Why? Why not? I want to believe 
                    there is a higher power, and I want to align my actions and being with it. Even if I decide there is not, then the 
                    fabric of life still exists, and it seems to follow Bryan Johnson's "Don't Die" philsophy, and I would want to be 
                    in a society where others and AI are at least guided by a philsophy of "Don't Die". Interesting podcast on his philosphy (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roHeUk7ApUo&t=5288s">link</a>).</li>
