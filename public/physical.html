            <h2>PHYSICAL WELLNESS</h2>
            <p>This area focuses on maintaining a healthy body through nutrition, exercise, and sleep. It emphasizes the importance of regular physical activity, balanced diet, and adequate rest to achieve overall well-being.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Current Efforts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>March To Optimal Health</b>: My journey to better health began after discovering I had high blood pressure (160/100), a condition likely developing unnoticed over six stressful years from high school through college. Being poor is expensive. Now with a bit more resources and motivation, I can manage my health better to ensure I have longevity in entrepreneurship.</li>
                <li><b>Half-Marathon Training</b>: Exercise can be tedious, but a reachable goal makes it a fun challenge. My goal is to run a half-marathon at a 7:30 pace. It's a structured approach that will improve my V02 max, meet WHO's exercise recommendations, consistently hit 10k steps daily, and elevate my overall confidence. Beyond the immediate benefits, developing stamina and endurance lays a solid foundation for other physical activities, like martial arts.</li>
                <li><b>Self-care Routine</b>: Recognizing that hygiene and self-care can sometimes be overlooked or under-taught, I am dedicating myself to establishing a robust self-care routine. This initiative is grounded in the belief that prevention is key, much like in car maintenance, where it's preferable to prevent issues rather than face emergencies. By integrating consistent self-care practices into my daily life, I aim to enhance my physical and mental well-being, ensuring that I'm not just functioning but thriving in every aspect of life. This commitment to self-care serves as a foundation for sustained health and resilience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Efforts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Hair</b>: Managing my hair and scalp has been a unique challenge. It often switches between extremes of dryness and oilness, occasionally leading to dandruff. While I've found a way to keep it under control, it often leaves my hair dry. Also, I want to experiment with different hairstyles once I can afford it -- I have been cutting my own hair since high school.</li>
                <li><b>Calisthenics</b>: Functional dynamic resistance training. To often in movies, the main character needs to pull themselves out of trouble.</li>
                <li><b>Jiu Jitsu</b>: Fun self-defense.</li>
                <li><b>Kickboxing / Muay Thai</b>: Fun self-defense.</li>
                <li><b>Wrestling</b>: Send me location.</li>
                <li><b>Swimming and Biking (Triatholon/Iron Man)</b>: Just because? I'd probably do this just to show off.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Personal Records (since 2023)</h2>
