        <h1>March To Optimal Health</h1>
    
        <h2>One Sentence Summary</h2>
        <p>Improving my health after a blood pressure scare by focusing on sleep, nutrition, stress, and exercise.</p>

        <h2 class="project_description_heading">Purpose</h2>
        <p class="project_description_p">The primary motivation and objectives behind this project.</p>
        <p>My interest in this project started because I had a blood pressure scare in March 2023. My blood pressure was measured at 160/110. That alcoholic uncle in your family probably has a lower blood pressure than me. Also, 3 out 9 of my aunts and uncles have passed in their 50s and 60s. The majority of them have diabetes. I want to have longevity and a good life, so fixing my health is important to me.</p>

        <h2 class="project_description_heading">Principles</h2>
        <p class="project_description_p">Guiding principles or constraints of this project.</p>
        <p>Principles and constraints include following WHO's dietary and phyical exercise suggestions as well as a broke college student's budget and time (meal-prepping). I don't have a preference for meat-only or vegan: it just needs to meet my dietary needs and budget constraints.</p>
        
        <h2 class="project_description_heading">Outcome Visioning</h2>
        <p class="project_description_p">Desired outcome of the project. Wild success.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Blood pressure seriousness confirmation</b>: after 90 days of following a disciplined plan (sleep, nutrition, exercise, and stress), either my blood pressure reaches a healthy level or I have confirmed there is something more serious that needs to be checked by a specialist.</li>
            <li><b>Healthy weight</b>: I want to reach a fat mass percentage of around 19%.</li>
            <li><b>Be more fit</b>:

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Near perfect sleep score</b>: Get a sleep score above 90 on the majority of days.</li>

        <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            I am on a journey to achieve the best health possible. I say optimal health because striving for perfect health could cost a lot of money, take up too much time, and even make life less enjoyable. I admire the centenarians in Sardinia, Italy. They didn't have all the fancy food, supplements, and health knowledge we have today, yet they have lived longer and healthier lives than many in the West. My goal is to live to 100 by meeting the basics of good health, along with my personal ambitions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first step is to plan your regimes for sleep, nutrition, fitness, and mental health. Everyone has different constraints and goals, so consider my goals my own. I start with trusted general advice, such as the World Health Organization's recommendation for diet and exercise, which you can take and adjust for your own goals. I've included all my sources in the reference section if you prefer to do the research yourself. Researching took me over 40 hours because I have high blood pressure, so I needed to delve slightly deepeter to understand how to manage it better.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you make your plan for the different pillars of health, you can optionally measure biomarkers. This helps confirm your progress or may guide you towards the areas you need to focus more on. Biomarker tests include a blood panel, body composition, daily health information, fitness measurements, and blood pressure. Note, some of these I have added for my own goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            In parallel to measuring your biomarkers, you can start purchasing equipment based on priorities and available resources. For my meal plan, I follow the following meals: oatmeal, lentils + chicken, and salad. Currently, I am also participating in Bryan Johnson's Blueprint 5000 study. In this study, I am taking supplements to see if they impact my biomarkers. I wanted to do this study in addition to improving other areas of my health to completely narrow out reasons for my blood pressure being so high in 90 days. If in 90 days my blood pressure is still too high, I can't possibly blame it on lack of exercise, bad nutrition, or bad sleep. Stress is a bit trickier to confirm, but if I see my blood pressure trending down, this confirms its not some underlying issue. After 90 days, I will adjust my meal plan to make up for the nutrients removed by dropping the Blueprint protocol.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, remember, life doesn't have to be filled with comfort or ease of living. A read that a centenarian survived war and poverty. Don't let the pressure of being poor act as an additional stressor, and don't adopt a victim mentality -- both will only add weight.
        </p>

        <h3 id="PreparationAndPlanning">Preparation and Planning</h3>
        <h4 id="PlanForMentalHealth">Plan for Mental Health and Stress Reduction</h4>
        <p>
            My plan is to improve my mental health and reduce stress through meditation, breathwork, and self-therapy. Both meditation and breathwork are new to me. I'm inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG">Dr. Alok Kanojia's</a> insights on the benefits of meditation, which motivate me to give it a try. I'll continue to update this section as I delve deeper into these practices.
        </p>
        <h5 id="GoalsMentalHealth">My Goals</h5>
        <p>
            For the past seven years, I've pushed myself hard in my studies, which has brought on a lot of stress and what I'd call "trauma". I don't mean trauma in the sense that I regret choices or feel like a victim, but more like I'm unnecessarily carrying burdens. My main goal is to lighten any subconscious loads I may have.
        </p>
        <p>
            Growing up was tough. I was raised by a single, immigrant mom who was often stressed. Being an immigrant myself and quite introverted, I often felt out of place. This background has led a bit of stress and trauma from both childhood and social situations. Again, my aim is to relieve myself of any burdens I am subsconsciously carrying.
        </p>
        <p>
            These stresses and the way I respond to them have shaped my relationships with my wife and family. They are not the worst, but they could be better. Since life is short, I want to actively work on improving these aspects of my life.

        <h4 id="PlanForSleep">Plan for Sleep</h4>
        <p class="nopm">I created my plan for sleep mostly using these resources: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPDQ1Tt3y14">Sleep Tips From A Sleep Scientist</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7veiyN4LqU">My Evening Routine - Top 1% Sleep Ranking </a>. My plan is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce light in your room at bedtime. Blackout your windows if needed.</li>
            <li>Reduce noise in your room at bedtime. Use earplugs if needed.</li>
            <li>Set room to a comfortable temperature. Try 67ºF (19.4ºC) if no preference.</li>
            <li>Have a 1 hour wind-down period where no devices are used. Use this time to clean up a bit, brush your teeth and do your skin care routine, read, or spend time with family. Personally, I will also use this time to:
                <ul class="nopm">
                    <li>Measure my blood pressure.</li>
                    <li>Meditate for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Listen to theta waves to further increase my sleepiness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Sleep at exactly the same time. I will aim to sleep at 9:30 PM.</li>
            <li>Wake up without an alarm, allowing for 8 to 9 hours of sleep.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="PlanForNutrition">Plan for Nutrition</h4>
        <h5 id="NutritionGuidelines">Guidelines</h5>
        <p>Let's start with guidelines from trusted sources. These are guidelines the majority of people should aim to follow.</p>
        <p class="nopm">Do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A varied, largely plant-based diet, and balancing energy intake with expenditure <a href="">[x]</a>.</li>
            <li>High-protein. Shown to lower triglycerides, which lowers the risk of heart disease <a href="">[x]</a>.</li>
            <li>High-unsaturated fat. A large portion of centenarian's diets in Sardinia seemed to consist of unsaturated fats <a href="">[x]</a>. Note, this slightly conflicts with WHO's recommendation <a href="">[x]</a>.</li>
            <li>"Obtaining the largest amount of energy from carbohydrates, mainly through legumes and wholegrain cereals" <a href="">[x]</a>.</li>
            <li>"Reducing total fats to less than 30% of total energy intake, shifting fat intake away from saturated and trans fat to unsaturated fats, and eliminating industrial trans fats from the diet" <a href="">[x]</a>. This is the statement which conflicts with centenarian's diets, in which 40% of calories come from unsaturated fat.</li>
            <li>"Reducing free sugars to less than 10% (ideally 5%) of total energy intake" <a href="">[x]</a>.</li>
            <li>"Limiting sodium intake to less than 2 grams per day (equivalent to 5 grams of salt)" <a href="">[x]</a>.</li>
            <li>"Consuming at least 400 grams of vegetables and fruit per day in adults and children above 10, and 250–350 grams per day in younger children" <a href="">[x]</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="nopm">Avoid or minimze:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Processed, baked, and fried food. Too many issues, such as high trans-fat, saturated fat, sodium, and sugar <a href="">[x]</a>. </li>
            <li>Saturated fats and trans-fats <a href="">[x]</a>. Typically from fried or baked foods. "Intake of saturated fats should be less than 10% of total energy intake" <a href="">[x]</a> and "trans-fats less than 1%" <a href="">[x]</a>.</li>
            <li>Sugary snacks and drinks <a href="">[x]</a>.</li>
            <li>Salt over 5 grams (or one teaspoon) <a href="">[x]</a>. "Salt should be iodized" <a href="">[x]</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 id="GoalsNutrition">My Goals</h5>
        <p class="nopm">My goals are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get BMI into the range: 18 to 25. This is about 118 to 164 lbs. I'll aim for 150 lbs.</li>
            <li>Meal-prep my own food. No pre-made food. Minimally processed food. Minimal sugar and flour.</li>
            <li>More fruits and veggies.</li>
            <li>Affordable meal plan.</li>
            <li>Do not overeat. Eat baseline needs (balanced energy expenditure) once I reach my optimal weight.</li>
            <li>Appropriate salt (max 2,400 mg a day). Inherent in the meals I have in mind, but I thought I should be explicit. In fact, I need to add (iodized) salt to my meals to meet my sodium intake goals.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="NutritionPlan">Plan</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Use my <a href="https://amzn.to/4cMu77F">Garmin watch</a> to track my active and passive calories (total energy expenditure).</li>
            <li>Use <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=766203&u=4140136&m=61121&urllink=&afftrack=">Cronometer.com</a> or (free <a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator">DRI Calculator</a>) to determine macronutrient and nutrient targets.
                <ul class="nopm">
                    <li>Macronutrients I am tracking: calories, protein, net carbs, and fat.</li>
                    <li>Nutrients I am tracking: fiber, fat (unsaturated, saturated, trans fatty acids, cholesterol), B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12, biotin, choline, folate, A, C, D, E, K, calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, sodium, and zinc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since I am currently participating in Bryan Johnson's Blueprint study in which participants take a variety of supplements to max out nearly all nutrients required daily for 90 days, my meal plan will need adjustments for the average person. I plan to adjust my meal plan and nutrient supplements after the trial because the Blueprint stack is expensive, and I will not continue it.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, my meal plan looks like:</p>
        <p class="nopm"><b>Blueprint Morning Mix</b></p>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        </ul>

        <h5 id="FoodGuide">Food Guide</h5>
        <p>I didn't realize how difficult and time-consuming it can be to create a meal plan to max out all of my macronutrient and nutrient needs until I planned my meals down to the gram.</p>
        <p>I approached my meal plan by starting with a list of raw foods I could afford and finding combinations that work well together. For example, oatmeal is really cheap yet it is packed with nutrients. From there, I add foods that slowly get me towards my goals through trial and error. Alternatively, I could have started with eggs. There are too many other foods that make sense for breakfast. For this process, I previously attempted to use the DRI calculator and an Excel sheet to track everything, but that was too time-consuming, so I ended up purchasing a yearly subscription of <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=766203&u=4140136&m=61121&urllink=&afftrack=">Cronometer</a>.</p>
